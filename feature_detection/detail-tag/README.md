# HTML5 Detail tag

This html tag allows users to hide additional information in a togglable section.

```HTML
<details>
    <summary>
        This will be shown with an arrow in front of it
    </summary>
    <p>This part will be hidden before the details element is clicked. Whenever details is clicked this will be shown. Details can also haven an open attribute, to be open as default</p>
</details>
```
### Fallback
The users clicks on a text element which opens and closes the extra information. If the browser does not support it al the text will be shown.

### Browser that can use it
