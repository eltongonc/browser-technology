# Scroll snapp Propperties

This CSS feature lets the developer manipulate the way the page or content scrolls. This is useful for carrousels and other image view components.

### Fallback
If the browser does not support the CSS feature the page or content will scroll normal

### Browser that can use it
This is a features that is not well supported by allot of browsers. Most browsers support it with a prefix. No mobile browser supports it.

| IE & Edge             | Firefox                   | Safar & Safari IOS |
|-                     -|-                         -|-                  -|
|Partially with prefix  |Partially no prefix needed |Partially with prefix, Safari 10.1 does fully support it |

### Live demo
I made an example that will show the snapping in action on the browsers that support. If the browser doesn't support it the sections will be expanded.
